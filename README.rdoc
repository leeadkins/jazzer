= jazzer

Helps Sinatra make beautiful music.

Sometimes you get an idea for a website. 

You usually want to get going as quickly as possible.

Jazzer is an opinionated scaffolding gem that creates a Sinatra-based application
with defaults that I'm comfortable with. I find that I do a lot of the same things 
each time I create a Sinatra app. Why not generate all that automagically?

It does nothing right now. Please stand by for something useful.
